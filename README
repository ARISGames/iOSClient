CLoning and Compiling ARIS

git clone git@github.com:ARISGames/iOSClient.git ARISiOSClient
cd ARISiOSClient
git submodule init
git submodule update


Configuring and Running automated Tests

1. Install bwoken - See https://github.com/bendyworks/bwoken
2. Install imagemagick: brew install imagemagick
3. Compile and Run the tests: bwoken test

Note, once you have compiled, you can quickly re-run the tests by running: bwoken test --skip-build

!-----------------------------------------------------!

Before installing imagemagick, make sure you have macports uninstalled and homebrew installed.

1. Check if macports or fink is installed (run these in terminal)
- $ which port
- $ which fink

2. if ($ which port) returns something that looks like /.rvm/bin/port , then macports is installed and needs to be uninstalled.
3. if ($ which fink) returns something, then fink is most likely installed and needs to be uninstalled.

4. Uninstall macports
- $ sudo port -fp uninstall installed
- Password: (enter password)
- (let it do it's thing, cleaning, uninstalling, deactivating)...
- $ sudo rm -rf /opt/local
- $ sudo rm -rf /Applications/DarwinPorts
- $ sudo rm -rf /Applications/MacPorts
- $ sudo rm -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.*
- $ sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts*.pkg
- $ sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg
- $ sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup
- $ sudo rm -rf /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0
- $ sudo rm -rf /Library/Tcl/macports1.0
- $ sudo rm -rf ~/.macports

-(optional, I didn't have to do this, and not sure how...) remove the /opt/local/bin from your $PATH

5. Uninstall fink (if necessary)
- (I didn't have to do this. Fink was not installed on mine.)
- Look up how to do this :)

6. Check again to see if macports was uninstalled.
- $ which port
- (This should return nothing if it was properly uninstalled.)

7. Install homebrew

8. Double check to see if macports is uninstalled when installing imagemagick
- $ brew install imagemagick
- (If no error saying "It appears you have MacPorts or Fink installed." you should be all set to go!)
